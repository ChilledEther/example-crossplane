# 🌇 Overview

The purpose of this repository is to educate others on what high level abstraction looks like when using Kubernetes as your driving force.

It abstracts away a lot of the pain from product teams and developers and moves the ownership of the process to platform engineers who oversee multiple teams and follow business standards.

This allows the platform team to bake in security, governance, efficiency, optimizations, changes, and much more when doing this method.

It can be paired with a GitOps approach so that the deployment is controlled via an operator, controlling drift and provisioning/deprovisioning.
